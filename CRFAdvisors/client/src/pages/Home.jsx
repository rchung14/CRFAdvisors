              Based on our experience servicing financial institutions in the Tri-State area, 
              I have found many institutions having trouble classifying, accounting for, and
              valuing troubled credits and assets. In this highly criticized and fragile FI 
              industry, I strongly believe that the credit risk management function is more 
              than just an assertion that a loan is properly classified, but also to evaluate 
              for any potential impairment as well as determine the impact on the Allowance for 
              Loan Losses
